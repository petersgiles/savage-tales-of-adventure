# Blood queen

The Blood Queen appears as a massive swollen maggot, with three
tentacles surrounding her gaping maw, and five more tentacles projecting
from her hindquarters. Any creatures she swallow continue to draw
initiative cards, when they draw clubs they emerge from her hindquarters
encased in a pod of slime and mucous, which the Blood Queen can
telepathically cause to explode (as Burst with an acid trapping) as a
free action.
