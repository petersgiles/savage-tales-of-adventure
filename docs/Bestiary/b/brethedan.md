# Brethedan

Brethedan are fleshy spheres with writhing tentacles. As a normal
action, a brethedan can merge with another adjacent brethedan,
increasing its Size by +1, giving it +1 wound level, and granting it
whichever Edge was currently assigned through the Adaption ability.
There is no limit to how many brethedans can merge in this way, but
their Size bonus never exceeds +12.
