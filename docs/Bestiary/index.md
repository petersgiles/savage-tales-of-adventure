The original **Savage Beasts** document, a free Savage Worlds Creature Collections, was originally dedicated to:The Savages, for keeping me inspired; to Shane Lacy Hensley, for coming up with the whole thing to begin with; and to my son Dante, for not hitting the keyboard too often while Daddy was working. Special thanks to Storn Cook, Cheyenne Wright, and Steve Long (Thanks them for all the good art in the old edition book). **Butch** Email: butch.curry AT gmail.com |

**About flying creatures**

I&#39;m modifying the standard notation for the flying creatures, turning into the Savage Worlds Deluxe standard. I&#39;m sorry for the players who still use the &quot;old&quot; SW:EX edition. I had to &quot;evolve&quot; the bestiary.

I&#39;m keeping some additional &quot;crunch&quot; to simulate slow acceleration creatures. This is an example showing the standard notation for this bestiary:

- **Flight** : Manticores have a Flying Pace of 8&quot; (only 4&quot; in the first round, because their massive bodies make it difficult for them to become initially airborne). They have a Climb of -1.

## **Templates**

Just a note about templates: simply add the value proposed. You don&#39;t need to make any maths, we made it for you: for example, as you can see in the Ancient template, Toughness +6 is gained with augmented Vigor, Armor and Size.

### Ancient ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png) - Template

_An Ancient is a &quot;template&quot; that you can apply on a &quot;normal&quot; beast, when you need a more powerful enemy quickly. Ancient animals are found in the deep of forests or other natural_ _environments__, usually guarding sacred places, or objects that needs to remain hidden from the civilized men, forever._

The creature becomes a Wild Card, if it wasn&#39;t before.

Attributes: Agility -1 step, remove the &quot;A&quot; from Smarts, Spirit +2 steps, Strength +3 steps, Vigor +2 steps

Skills: Fighting +1 step, Guts +2 steps, Intimidate +2 steps, Notice +2 steps

Pace: +2 (every type of movement); Parry: +1; Toughness: +6 (+1)

Bonus Edges:

- **Chooose one from** : Level Headed, Frenzy, Fear. If the creature had the same Edge before, turn it into the Improved version.

Special Abilities:

- **Armor** : +1 step. The skin is sturdier.
- **Natural weapons** : +1 step of Damage.
- **Size +3** (eventually check for Large/Huge/Gargantuan)

Here there is an example of Ancient template applied to a standard creature from this bestiary (in dark red the altered Stats):

|
 | **Chikakas the Ancient (Bat, Giant)** **[WC]**The sacred white giant bat, defender of the caves.Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d12+1, Vigor d10Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d12, Stealth d10Pace: 4; Parry: 6; Toughness: 11 (1)Edges:
- Level Headed.
Special Abilities:
- Armor: +1. The skin is sturdier.
- Bite: Str+d6
- Fear
- Flight: Giant bats have a Flying Pace of 14&quot;.
- Size +3
- Slow: On the ground, giant bats can only crawl about at a Pace of 4.
- Sonar: Bats can &quot;see&quot; in complete darkness with a form of active sonar; they ignore all lighting penalties. However, when attacking opponents standing still (i.e., those who take no action, such as movement or attacking, or who are on Hold), they&#39;re at a -4 to attack rolls.
 |
| --- | --- |

### Boss ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png) - Template

_A Boss is a &quot;template&quot; that you can apply on any &quot;normal&quot; enemy, when you need the classic_ _E __nd__ -L __evel_ _B__ adass - and you need him quickly! A Boss can hold his own against an entire heroes party,_ _however he&#39; __s usually found in the company of his last, loyal-till-the-end minions.__ He never surrenders without a long, bloody fight!_

The enemy becomes a Wild Card, if he wasn&#39;t before.

Attributes: all attributes gain +1 Step

Skills: All relevant skills gain +1 Step; if needed, Boss can roll any other skill as he has them at d4.

Pace: +1; Parry: +1; Toughness: +3 (+1)

Hindrances: Usually Boss has Bloodthirsty and Overconfident.

**Bonus**  **Edge**** s** (choose one): Frenzy, Fear (monstrous ability), No Mercy.

**Special Abilities** (choose one or more, suit your Boss as you need it):

- **Come get some!** : The boss is faster, far more expert than player&#39;s characters, or simply one step higher on the evolutive ladder! He has two or more separate turns per round instead of the usual one. Each turn is handled independently with its own actions, and its initiative card/s. The Boss gain 1 extra turn for each 3 players at the game table (ie. with 7 players, Boss get 4 turns with their initiative cards, as if he were 4 different enemy characters).
- **Boss feels no pain!** : He is impervious to, or has learned to fight on through, the most intense pain. The Boss suffers no wound penalties, and he recovers quickly from shock and trauma, adding +2 to his Spirit roll when attempting to recover from being Shaken (cumulative with other effects, like Combat Reflexes).
- **Boss hates bookkeeping!** : If the Boss has Powers, do not keep track of his PPs. He has a lot of them, trust me.
- **Boss is the big**** one!**: Size +1. If he becomes big enough, increase to Large/Huge/Gargantuan as appropriate.
- **You aren&#39;t even a challenge!** : The Boss loves having lots of foes to fight, and he&#39;s masterful at fighting in a crowd. Foes get only ½ Gang-Up bonuses against the Boss (so, 4 characters in melee with the Boss get +1 Gang-Up bonus, instead of +3).
- **Muahahahah! (****o****ptional)**: When Incapacitated, the Boss explodes! This may be a final activation, a dead-man switch, or whatever trapping is appropriate. Everything within a Large Burst template take 3d6 damage (Agility at -2 to avoid the blast) of an appropriate trapping (fire, acid, radiation, etc). This final attack may damage or destroy the surrounding area (as appropriate), and of course it destroys the Boss gear... Take this, you greedy characters!
- **Secret Getaway! (****o****ptional)**: When he should normally be Incapacitated, his secret getaway plan is activated instead! An explosion or other dramatic event distracts the party, and the Boss is momentarily lost from sight. Subsequent searches fail to find his body. NOTE: this ability should be used only one time, then &quot;discarded&quot;.

**Special Gear** (apply both):

- **Armor:**** + ****1**. The Boss&#39;s existing armor improves (or he now has armor).
- **Weapons:**** +1 damage**. The Boss has better weapons/techniques, dealing +1 Damage.

Here there is an example of Boss template applied to a standard creature from this bestiary (in dark red the altered Stats). This boss is actually fighting against 5 player characters:

Cockatrice, Boss W.C.

Bizarre magical rooster/serpents, capable of petrifying those they touch.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d8, Notice d8, (all the other skills eventually rolled at d4)

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 7 (1)

Hindrances: Overconfident

Bonus Edge: Fear

Special Abilities:

    - Beak: Str+d4+1
    - Armor: +1 (thick skin)
    - Flight: Cockatrices have a Flying Pace of 10&quot; (only 5&quot; in the first round, because their ungraceful bodies make it difficult for them to become initially airborne). They have a Climb of -2.
    - Petrification: Any living creature hit by a cockatrice in combat (either by beak with a normal Fighting roll) must immediately make a Vigor roll or be turned to stone. They&#39;ll remain stone until the cockatrice is killed or a Greater Healing spell is cast upon them (though this spell will not simultaneously heal any damage they might have taken prior to being turned to stone).
    - Size 0 (thanks to _Boss is the big one!_)
    - Come get some!: one bonus turn per round (against 5 player characters).
    - Boss feels no pain!: No wound penalties, +2 to recover from being Shaken.
    - Boss hates bookkeeping!: Do not keep track of his PPs.
    - You aren&#39;t even a challenge!: Foes get 1/2 Gang-Up bonuses against the Boss.
    - Secret Getaway! (fleeing in the ruins): When should be Incapacitated, the Boss gives a last furious tail sweep, making some adjacent rocks to crumble: the Boss is momentarily lost from sight. Subsequent searches fail to find his body. He&#39;ll return, soon!

## **Bestiary**

# A

### Acolyte

Acolytes are non-powered clerics, or cultists; they&#39;re the lowest level of a clerical or a religious organization, lacking the ability to manifest miracles. They&#39;re often led by a more powerful cleric.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d8,Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Knowledge: Religion d8, Notice d4, Shooting d4

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 (2)

Gear:

- **Armor +2** : In a fantasy setting, acolytes usually wear medium-weight armor, such as chain mail. In a more modern setting, they&#39;ll wear only their ceremonial robes.
- **Weapons** : Acolytes typically carry swords, clubs, or maces; these are Str+d6 weapons. Some will carry crossbows (15/30/60, 2d6, AP2, takes 1 action to reload). Most will also carry a dagger, usually ceremonial but always functional (Str+d4). Modern acolytes will carry low-quality firearms (10/20/40, 2d6-1, Semi-Auto)

### Cultists

For a foaming-at-the-mouth cultist of Things Men Was Not Meant To Know, add the following:

- **Fervor** : Cultists can whip themselves up into a religious fervor. This takes a Spirit roll and a normal action. Once in this frenzy, they get a +2 to all Fighting and Guts rolls, and a –2 to any Smarts, Shooting, or Notice rolls. This fervor lasts until the combat ends.

### Aliens

Where are these creatures from? Another planet? Another time? Another dimension? Who can say?

![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_4b9773869df4da28.png) Shape Change, unless otherwise listed, is impossible for aliens.

### Damned Children ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These are human children who have been genetically manipulated by the Grays either pre-conception or in utero. From birth there&#39;s no question that they&#39;re somehow... different. The Damned often serve as advance scouts for the alien invaders. They&#39;re all born with blonde hair and blue eyes.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d10, Spirit d10, Strength d4, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d4, Intimidation d10, Knowledge (Alien science) d12, Notice d8, Persuasion d8, Repair d8, Stealth d10

Pace: 6; Parry: 4; Toughness: 4

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : Small; Level Headed

Special Abilities:

- **Fear** : When using their Mind Control power, the eyes of the Damned glow eerily; anyone seeing this happen must make a Guts check.
- **Know it All** : Constant use of their Mind Reading power gives the Damned an almost encyclopedic knowledge of Earth lore. Treat all but the most rarified information as Common Knowledge for them.
- **Mind Control** : The Damned can use the Puppet power at will, and get a +2 to their Spirit rolls when doing so.
- **Mind Link** : The Damned are typically inserted onto Earth in packs of up to a dozen. These packs are in constant mental contact with each other, allowing them to share information instantaneously with each other: when one of them learns something, they all learn it. There is a drawback: if one of them becomes Shaken, the rest of them do, too. (This doesn&#39;t extend to Wounds, though!)
- **Mind Reading** : By making an opposed Spirit roll against a target, the Damned can read their mind. With a normal success, they can scan surface thoughts; subsequent raises allow them to scan deeper.

### Dark Stalker

Dark stalkers are small insectoid aliens that hang on the shadowy sides of ceilings, waiting for unsuspecting victims to pass below. When they spot prey, they race down from their hidings, and strike with lightning speed. Their prey almost never sees them coming before it&#39;s too late.

Before they strike, dark stalkers are almost totally silent. They emit an evil hissing sound when fighting that sounds almost like a riled serpent.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4(A), Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d8

Skills: Climb d12+2, Fighting d10, Guts d6, Intimidation d10, Notice d8

Pace: 8; Parry: 7; Toughness: 5

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +2** : Dark stalkers have thick spiny hides.
- **Bite** : Str+d8.
- **Charge** : Dark stalkers charge on their first round of attack, gaining +4 to hit and damage as they scramble down from their hidings.
- **Size -1**
- **Wall Walking** : Dark stalkers can climb walls with great skill at their normal Pace, though they cannot hang upside down.

### Grays ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These beings generally appear to be your archetypal aliens: gray skinned, tall and spindly, with huge black eyes and small slits for mouths, though they can take on other forms. These particular aliens do not come in peace.

They utilize a bizarre mixture of super-science and mysticism which to a large degree has baffled Earth scientists. More recently, they have completed development of the technology to distill pain and fear from Earth creatures as a source of techno-occult power. (Hence the rise in horrifying abductions and cattle mutilations.) At some point their supply of such power will reach critical mass; what happens then is up to you, but it certainly won&#39;t be anything good... The Grays find combat distasteful, and allow their servants to handle it for them.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d12, Spirit d10, Strength d8, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d10, Intimidation d10, Knowledge (Occult Science) d12, Knowledge (Torture) d12, Notice d10, Shooting d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 4; Toughness: 5

Edges: Arcane Resistance, Level Headed

Gear:

- **Hypodermic** : Str+d4. These are foot-long and wickedly barbed. If the Gray hits with a raise, the extra damage inflicted is caused by blood and other fluids (and sometimes solids!) being extracted from the target. Damage from a hypo is incredibly painful; those Shaken by one are at a -2 to their Spirit roll to recover.
- **Implants** : These are small bits of metal implanted into victim during their time with the Grays. They allow the aliens to track the victim anywhere on Earth; they also transmit fear, pain, and feelings of paranoia and isolation back to the Grays for distillation.
- **Probes** : These aren&#39;t used for gathering information, but for inflicting pain. They allow the Grays to torture a victim for days (or longer) without doing any permanent damage to them.

Special Abilities:

- **Alien Intellect** : Grays get +2 to any Smarts based opposed rolls against normal humans; their thought patterns are unpredictable, at best.
- **Fear**
- **Garmonbozia** : Grays gain power and sustenance from the pain and suffering of others. When injected into themselves, it both removes any Wounds they have and boosts their Agility and Strength to d10 for one hour. When injected into a human, they suffer incredible agony. They must make a Vigor roll at -2 immediately to avoid being Shaken. They must continue to make Vigor rolls every round for 3 +1d6 rounds or take a level of Fatigue and become Shaken again if they&#39;ve recovered. If reduced to Incapacitated by Fatigue, any additional Fatigue levels become Wounds instead.
- **Immunity** : Grays are immune to the mental powers of the Damned Children and Nordics.
- **Mind Wipe** : Grays can wipe an individuals memories, up to 48 hours worth, with an opposed Smarts roll. The memories aren&#39;t really gone, though, just deeply suppressed. They still surface in the form of dreams and hallucinations, and can be recovered through extensive hypnotherapy.
- **Paralysis** : Grays can induce paralysis in humans with their minds. Make an opposed Spirit roll; if the Gray wins, the target can&#39;t move for 3 rounds. Each Gray that acts in concert to hold the victim doubles the duration (6 rounds with 2 Grays, 12 rounds with 3, etc.); use the Cooperative Roll rules to have them assist. Engaging the paralysis counts as an action for the Grays, but maintaining it does not.

### Men in Black

There is considerable speculation on who these agents really work for; is it the Grays? Are they part of a government black op? Someone else, someone we haven&#39;t seen yet? Or do they work for no one but themselves, serving an agenda we can&#39;t hope to understand? Men in Black are known to appear wherever a great deal of psychic/supernatural activity has occurred, or is about to occur. They look more or less normal, but their features are uneven, and their voices project down into deep subharmonics. Their behavior is erratic, at best.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d10, Strength d10, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d10, Intimidation d8, Knowledge (Alien technology) d8, Notice d8, Persuasion d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 7

**Edges** : Arcane Resistance, Brawny, Level Headed

Gear:

- **Vehicle - Edsel** : What&#39;s weirder than the MiB&#39;s driving Edsels? The fact that they look like they just drove off of the assembly line. A careful examination under the hood reveals that although the engine appears normal at first glance, it&#39;s put together completely wrong, and could never actually run... They&#39;re identical to Sports Cars (see SW:EX page 55).
- **Guns** : These are functionally identical to a Colt .45, and look approximately like one as well. Like their Edsels, if the inner workings are examined, there&#39;s no way these weapons should be able to actually fire.

Special Abilities:

- **Unshakable** : MiB&#39;s ignore all Wound penalties and are never Shaken by attacks.

### Nordic ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Contrary to conspiracy theory, the Nordics are not a separate alien race (they&#39;re alternately described as being in league with, or opposed to, the Grays). Rather, they are Damned Children who have grown to full size... and full power. Despite this power, they remain the thralls of the Grays. Nordics are all statuesque (averaging 6&#39;6&quot;), with perfectly chiseled features, platinum blonde hair and pale blue eyes. With all their power, they&#39;re still more comfortable with others of their kind around, and are almost never encountered alone.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d12, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d10, Intimidation d10, Knowledge (alien science) d12, Notice d12, Piloting d8, Repair d10, Shooting d8, Stealth d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 6

**Edges** : Level Headed, Combat Reflexes, Hard to Kill

Special Abilities:

- **Know it All** : Having grown up constantly reading the minds of those around them, the Nordicshave a vast array of knowledge to draw upon, allowing them to make a Common Knowledge roll for all but the most bizarre or trivial minformation.
- **Mind Control** : Nordics can use the Puppet power at will, getting a +2 to their Spirit roll. They can use this power on up to three people at a time, though they can only activate it once a round. Unless all the targets are performing similar actions, the Nordic must make a Smarts roll each round to maintain control. If it fails, all the targets are freed.
- **Mind Reading** : Nordics can scan the surface thoughts of anyone within their line of sight with a Spirit roll, getting a +2 to the roll. With a raise, they can read the targets recent memories, and with two raises they can read all their memories.
- **Telekinesis** : Nordics can use the Telekinesis power at will, lifting 120 pounds normally, or 600 on a raise of their Spirit roll.

### UFO&#39;s

The ships used by the Grays are not simply vehicles; they are living, sentient beings enslaved by the aliens and tortured into subservience. The Grays use their dark science to alter the appearances of their ships, so no two of them look exactly the same.

Acc/Top Speed: 100/1000+ (see below)

Climb: 100; Toughness: 16 (4)

Crew: 2+50; Cost: Alien only

Notes: Advanced Stealth Tech (as Stealth Paint); Heavy Armor; Improved Stabilizer

- **Sensor Array** : UFO&#39;s ignore all lighting penalties, and the pilot gets a +2 to Notice rolls to spot other aircrafts.
- **FTL/Interdimensional Travel** : Depending on what you choose as the Grays place of origin, their vehicles will have either faster-than-light drives or will be capable of travelling between dimensions or through time. Regardless, the engine warps space/time, creating some unusual effects: &quot;lost time&quot;, disruption of Earthly electronics, etc.

Weapons:

- **Particle Beam** : 100/200/400, Damage 4d10 (Heavy Weapon), AP 10, ROF 1.
- **Tractor Beam** : These allow the craft to manipulate items up to 12&quot; away; it can lift, hold, and manipulate up to two tons.

### Antelope

You can use this template for other, similar animals such as deer, elk, or (non-magical!) reindeer.

### Ape, Mutant ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Whether it&#39;s Nazi scientists in a pulp setting or a deranged wizard in a fantasy world, someone always makes a super-intelligent ape! They typically serve as laboratory assistants for their creators, and are capable of speech.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d12+1, Vigor d8

Skills: Climbing d8, Fighting d10, Guts d10, Knowledge (Science or Magic) d8, Notice d6, Shooting d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 8

Gear:

- Weapons: The apes&#39; creator will typically arm them with a large, powerful weapon, such as a **Greatsword** (Str+d10, Parry -1; due to their size, they can wield them one-handed) or large gun.

Special Abilities:

- **Berserk** : Whenever a mutant ape is Shaken or Wounded, it must make a Spirit roll at -2 or give in to it&#39;s more animalistic urges. In addition to the normal Berserk modifiers, it&#39;s effective Smarts drops to d6 (A), and it cannot use it&#39;s Knowledge or Shooting skills.
- **Fleet Footed** : Normally, mutant apes would never stoop (literally!) to running on all fours, as they consider it beneath them. They will in a pinch, though, allowing them to roll a d8 for Running.
- **Leaping** : Mutant apes can leap 3&quot;, +1&quot; with a Strength roll.
- **Level Headed** : This Edge doesn&#39;t function when the ape is Berserk.
- **Punch** : Str damage. These apes&#39; claws are usually kept filed down, to make their lab work easier, and their fangs are removed to make speech easier for them.
- **Size +2**

### Bandit

Human brigands. They specialize in &quot;highway robbery&quot;, capturing poorly guarded merchant caravans.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d4, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Climbing d6, Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d4, Shooting d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 6 (1)

Gear:

- **Armor +1** : Bandits wear poorly-tended armor; regardless of its type, it only adds a +1 to Toughness.
- Weapons: Most bandits carry **clubs** or **daggers** , which do Str+d4 damage, though some may have a **bow** (range 12/24/48, damage 2d6).

Special Abilities:

- **Cowardly** : Bandits will only initiate an attack when they outnumber their targets by at least 2-to-1. If they&#39;re reduced to even odds, make a Spirit roll for them at -2 each round; failure means they run.

### Basilisk

Ten foot long, sinuous magical lizards, made famous for their ability to turn men to stone with their gaze.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d4, Stealth d4

Pace: 5; Parry: 5; Toughness: 9

Special Abilities:

- **Bite** : Str+d4
- **Slow** : Basilisks have a Pace of 5 and only roll a d4 for running.
- **Size +3**
- **Stone Gaze** : The basilisk can turn those who meet its gaze to stone. Anyone surprised by the basilisk meets its gaze automatically. Anyone engaged in melee combat with the basilisk meets its gaze automatically unless looking away; those who do choose to look away take a -4 to their Fighting rolls, while the basilisk gets a +2 to hit them. Using a mirror, you can cut this to a -2 to your Fighting roll, and give the basilisk a +1, though this precludes the use of a shield. Those who meet its gaze must immediately make a Vigor check or be turned to stone; they&#39;ll remain in this state until the basilisk chooses to release them or until it is killed. Use of the Greater Healing spell will also return a stone character to normal, though it will not simultaneously heal any wounds they might have received prior to being petrified. This power only works against opponents within melee range, and it does not work in complete darkness.

![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_4b9773869df4da28.png) Shape Change, Heroic. Stone Gaze wears off when Shape Change does.

### Bats

### Bat, Normal

A regular, cave-dwelling bat. They&#39;re not really dangerous, but can scare those they catch unaware (hence the Intimidation skill).

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d4, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d4, Intimidation d4, Notice d8, Stealth d12

Pace: 1; Parry: 4; Toughness: 3

- **Fear +1** : Bats can cause the weak-willed to freak out; take a +1 to your Guts check.
- **Flight** : Bats have a Flying Pace of 12&quot;.
- **Nocturnal** : In normal daylight, bats take a -4 to all rolls; reduce this to -2 on heavily overcast days.
- **Size -2**
- **Small** : Opponents take a -2 to any attack rolls against them.
- **Slow** : When on the ground, bats crawl at Pace 1, with no running.
- **Sonar** : Bats can &quot;see&quot; in complete darkness with a form of sonar; they ignore all lighting penalties. However, when attacking opponents standing still (i.e., those who take no action, such as movement or attacking, or who are on Hold), they&#39;re at a -4 to attack rolls.

### Bat, Giant

These massive creatures (nearly as large as a full-grown man) are ravenous meat eaters, while the vampiric variety subsists solely on blood.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Intimidation d8, Notice d8, Stealth d10

Pace: 2; Parry: 5; Toughness: 5

Special Abilities:

- **Bite/Claws** : Str+d4
- **Death From Above** : A flying giant bat that hits with a raise causes damage as usual. In addition, the thing grasps its prey in its claws, swoops into the air, then lets go before it can be hurt by the victim&#39;s flailing. The drop is typically from about 12 yards, so the damage is 4d6. Characters on Hold or who have not yet taken their action may attempt to hold on by making an opposed Strength roll. If successful, the prey continues to struggle. With a raise, the victim forces the creature close enough to a landing spot to jump free without taking damage.
- **Fear**
- **Flight** : Giant bats have a Flying Pace of 12&quot;.
- **Slow** : On the ground, giant bats can only crawl about at a Pace of 2.
- **Sonar** : Bats can &quot;see&quot; in complete darkness with a form of active sonar; they ignore all lighting penalties. However, when attacking opponents standing still (i.e., those who take no action, such as movement or attacking, or who are on Hold), they&#39;re at a -4 to attack rolls.

### Vampire Bats

For vampire bats, use the Giant Bat and add the following:

- **Paralyzing Bite** : Characters who are Shaken by the bite of a vampire bat must make a Vigor roll or be unable to move for 1d6 rounds.
- **Infection** : Some (1 in 10) vampire bats can pass on true vampirism with their bite. Any one killed by one of these bats will become a vampire 1d4 days after death, unless appropriate precautions are taken.

### Beetles, Giant

Here are three varieties of giant beetle: fire, oil, and tiger.

### Fire Beetle

These 2 ½&#39; long beetles are usually found underground. They have glowing glands above their eyes and on their back which allow them to see in the dark.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d4, Guts d4, Notice d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 4; Toughness: 6 (1)

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +1** : Tough carapace.
- **Bite** : Str+d6
- **Fluorescent Glands** : The beetle halves all lighting penalties. These glands can be removed after the beetle is dead (make an Agility roll at -2 to do so); they give off light in a 2&quot; radius for 1d6 days.
- **Low Light Vision** : Ignore penalties for dim and dark light.

![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_4b9773869df4da28.png) Shape Change, Novice

### Oil Beetle

Oil beetles are 3&#39; long, oily black in color, and can burrow underground.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d4, Notice d4, Stealth d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 (2)

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +2** : Tough carapace.
- **Bite** : Str+d6
- **Burrowing** : An oil beetle can dig through loose earth and soil at Pace 6&quot;.
- **Oil** : Oil beetles can squirt at an opponent within melee range a stream of irritating, oily fluid, that raises painful blisters. The target may make an Agility roll at -2 to avoid the steam. If the target fail the roll, he takes a level of Fatigue. The blisters go away after 24 hours. If the target rolls a 1 on his Agility die (regardless of his Wild Die), he is automatically blinded by the oil. The victim&#39;s sight returns in 1d4 days. Multiple squirtings have no additional effect.

![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_4b9773869df4da28.png) Shape Change, Novice

### Tiger Beetle

The largest of the giant beetles, tigers are 4&#39; long, with particularly large and fearsome mandibles. They live in grasslands, and are black and orange striped like a tiger.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d6, Stealth d6

Pace: 8; Parry: 5; Toughness: 8 (2)

### Berserker

Crazed barbarian warriors, berserkers are fearsome foes.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d4, Survival d6, Throwing d4

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 7 (1)

**Edges** : Berserk, Combat Reflexes

Gear:

- **Armor +1** : Heavy furs and rough leather hide.
- Weapons: **Axes** , **swords** , and **cudgels** of primitive design - never ranged weapons (Str+d6).

Special Abilities:

- **Berserker Rage** : Berserkers can force themselves into a fighting rage. By making a Spirit roll, they can drive themselves into the berserk frenzy (see Berserk edge) voluntarily.
- **Brave** : Berserkers get a +2 to their Guts checks and to oppose Intimidation rolls. In skirmish level encounters, Berserkers do not need to make morale rolls.
- **Scare Tactics** : Before combat, a berserkers unit (a group of 10 or more) can try to frighten their foes by chanting, beating on their shields, and the like. Treat this as an Intimidation roll at +2.

### Blobs

### Black Blob

An amorphous blob, roughly thirty feet in diameter. They&#39;re not massive creatures, but are spread out over a wide area.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d4, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d4, Notice d12, Stealth d10

Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 9

Special Abilities:

- **Acidic Touch** : Blobs secrete a powerful acid that eats anything but stone. By making a Touch attack (+2 to Fighting), they inflict 2d8 damage. Any non-magical weapons or armor they come in contact with will most likely be ruined at the end of the round they touch it (or it touches them, in the case of weapons); on a 1-4 on d6, the item corrodes away to a smoking heap of goo.
- **Fearless** : Black blobs have no true intellect to speak of; they are thus immune to Fear, and cannot be Intimidated or Taunted.
- **Invulnerable** : Weapons and most spells do no damage against a blob; they only cause it to split and reform (this happens whenever the blob is Shaken). They can only be harmed by fire; torches, for example, do 1d10 damage to them. Fire-based spells do full damage.
- **Large** : Opponents get a +2 to all attack rolls against a blob, due to its size.
- **Ooze** : Blobs are amorphous creatures. As such, they get the following bonuses: +2 to recover from Shaken; no damage from called shots; immune to poison and disease. They can&#39;t be blinded or deafened, and ignore all lighting penalties. They have no facing to speak of, and those fighting them in groups are denied any Ganging Up bonuses. Blobs can squeeze themselves through openings as small as an inch across.
- **Slow** : Blobs have a Pace of 4 and cannot run.
- **Size +4**
- **Wall Walker** : Blobs can move on walls and ceilings at their normal Pace.

### Cavern Crawler

Crawlers hide in caves - the deeper and darker the better - waiting for something living to come within reach.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d12

Pace: 2; Parry: 5; Toughness: 6

Special Abilities:

- **Acidic Touch** : Oozes attack by secreting a powerful acid: making a Touch attack (+2 to Fighting), they inflict 2d6 damage. Any nonmagical weapons or armor they come in contact with will most likely be ruined at the end of the round they touch it (or it touches them, in the case of weapons); on a 1-3 on d6, the item corrodes away to a smoking heap of goo.
- **Fearless** : Cavern crawlers have no true intellect to speak of; they are thus immune to Fear, and cannot be Intimidated or Taunted.
- **Immunity** : Crawlers take no damage from cold or fire based attacks.
- **Ooze** : Cavern crawlers are amorphous blobs. As such, they get the following bonuses: +2 to recover from Shaken; no damage from called shots; immune to poison and disease. They have no facing to speak of, and those fighting them in groups are denied any Ganging Up bonuses. Oozes can squeeze themselves through openings as small as an inch across. They can&#39;t be blinded or deafened, either; they &#39;see&#39; by feeling vibrations and changes in air density, across their entire surface (making it exceptionally difficult to sneak up on them), and thus ignore all lighting penalties.
- **Size +1**
- **Slow** : Crawlers have a Pace of 2, and can&#39;t run.
- **Wall Walker** : They can move up walls and across ceilings without difficulty.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d12+10, Vigor d12

Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d12, Stealth d6

Pace: 4; Parry: 5; Toughness: 17

Special Abilities:

- **Acidic Touch** : The giant blobs acid eats through organic materials (2d10 damage on a Touch attack). Stone and metal can&#39;t be dissolved. Normal clothing offers no protection, as the acid seeps through almost instantly, but HAZMAT-style uniforms will stop it.
- **Crush** : Str damage, plus Size bonus and acid. This is treated as a Heavy Weapon.
- **Fear -2**
- **Fearless** : The blobs have no true intellect to speak of; they are thus immune to Fear, and cannot be Intimidated or Taunted.
- **Gargantuan** : Can only be hurt by Heavy Weapons; adds Size bonus to crushing attacks, minus Size bonus of target; ignore armor of vehicles when crushing.
- **Ooze** : +2 to recover from Shaken; no damage from called shots; immune to poison and disease; no Ganging Up bonuses apply; squeeze through openings as small as an inch across; can&#39;t be blinded or deafened; ignore all lighting penalties.

### Bugbear

Bugbears are cousins to goblins, but larger, more powerful, and less clever. Despite their size, they&#39;re quite stealthy, and prefer to wait until they can get the Drop on an opponent to attack.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d10, Vigor d10

Skills: Climbing d4, Fighting d8, Guts d6, Notice d6, Shooting d4, Stealth d10, Throwing d8

- **Three Headed** : The chimera&#39;s three heads afford it the following bonuses; it gets a +2 to all Notice rolls, a +2 to recover from Shaken, and called shots to the head do no additional damage. However, a called shot to the head which results in at least 1 wound will kill that head, though the creature suffers no particular ill effects from this.

(Petrification wears off either when Shape Change wears off, or if Shape Changer is rendered unconscious)

### Corrosive Slime

This creature looks like… well, like slime! It&#39;s acidic touch eats away inanimate objects, and turns any flesh it contacts into more slime. The slime itself isn&#39;t really a living opponent, so it should be treated more as an environmental hazard rather than a monster.

Contact with the slime will immediately begin to dissolve any metal or wood it contacts; if it&#39;s not burned or frozen off within 3 rounds, the items will be rendered useless, and will be completely dissolved in 6 rounds. Any cold or fire based magic will destroy it utterly, or flames equivalent to a normal torch (though these will damage the victim as well, of course!). If the slime isn&#39;t removed from living flesh in 3 rounds, the target must begin making Vigor saves each round or take 2d6 damage as they&#39;re turned into slime themselves.

- **Fearless** : Crabs are essentially mindless creatures; as such, they&#39;re immune to Fear, Intimidation, and Taunts.
- **Large** : Crabs are big creatures; opponents get a +2 to their attack rolls against them.
- **Size +4**

### Demons &amp; Devils

Demons and devils are extra dimensional beings whose sole purpose is the corruption and destruction of human souls. Demons are wild, chaotic, unpredictable, and dedicated to the spreading of pain and suffering. Devils are cool, calculating, manipulative, and are more inclined to trick humans into corrupting themselves or each other.

- In some settings (especially gritty / horror) a special ritual or item must be used to destroy or exorcise a demon. The ritual or item is determined on a case by case basis.
- Also, you might want to add some of these following abilities, depending on which best reflect the nature of these creatures in your specific setting:

- **Immunity** : Demons are immune to poison and disease.
- **Unnatural Resistance** : Half-damage from non-magical attacks except for their Weakness.
- **Unwavering** : Demons get +2 to recover from being Shaken.
- **Weakness (material)**: Demons are vulnerable to weapons forged with setting specific material [choose from starfall, cold iron, white silver, blessed...]; they take normal damage from them.
- **Weakness (Holy Symbol)**: Demons suffer a –2 penalty to Fighting attacks against anyone brandishing a holy symbol.

### Triceratops

Trikes are among the most recognizable of dinosaurs, with their distinctive head-ridge and three horns. Normally docile plant-eaters, they are terrible foes if they - or their young - are threatened.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12+5, Vigor d12

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d10, Intimidation d6, Notice d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 16 (3)

- **Charge** : If the trike moves 6&quot; in a straight line before attacking, it gets a +2 to hit and damage.
- **Gore** : Str+d8.
- **Large** : Trikes are big creatures; normal sized foes get a +2 to attack rolls against them.

### Tyrannosaurus Rex ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Modern science believes that T-Rex was little more than a massive, lumbering jackal, but that&#39;s no fun at all. Here&#39;s Rex as we know and love him; hail to the King, baby!

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d12, Strength d12+7, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d8, Intimidation d12, Notice d6, Tracking d6

- **Fearless** : The Rex is immune to Fear and Intimidation.
- **Huge** : Opponents get a +4 to hit the Rex.

- **Stomp** : Str damage. The Rex&#39;s stomp counts as a Heavy Weapon. A stomped foe must make an opposed Strength roll against the Rex to break free. As long as the Rex doesn&#39;t move, it will continue to do Str damage to the victim each round (though typically it will bite them to death once it has them trapped), and gets a +2 to hit and damage to its bite attacks against them.
- **Swallow Whole** : Rexes can swallow prey as large as Size +1 whole. While engulfed, the target is grappled as per the core rulebook and suffers 2d6 damage per round from digestive juices, until eaten or cut out the worm&#39;s stomach. Armor offers no protection.

### Djinni ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Ancient, powerful spirits from a desert dimension, djinn are sometimes captured and forced into servitude by particularly powerful sorcerers. Lesser djinn are used as guardians and assassins by those who summon them, as they lack the power of wish fulfillment their more powerful cousins, the True Djinn, posses.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d10, Spirit d12+2, Strength d12+1, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d12, Notice d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 9

Special Abilities:

- **Flight** : Djinn&#39;s are creatures of the air; they fly at a speed of 12&quot; with a Climb of 3. They may not run.
- **Gaseous Form** : The Djinn may convert it&#39;s body into mist by making a Vigor roll. While in this form, they can squeeze themselves through openings as small as an inch across, and they generally follow the Ethereal rules (see SW:EX page 141)
- **Invisibility** : As the spell. The Djinn becomes invisible by making a Spirit roll; it remains invisible for three rounds. If it takes any action other than movement (including Flight) while invisible, it must make another Spirit roll at -2 to maintain the effect. The djinn can&#39;t use it&#39;s Whirlwind or Gaseous Form powers while invisible, nor can it turn invisible while either of these powers is already in effect.
- **Invulnerability** : Djinn are immune to all attacks save those from magic or magical/blessed weapons.
- **Partially incorporeal** : Djinni is partially incorporeal at all times. This conferes to them +2 Toughness bonus.
- **Punch** : Str damage.
- **Size +2** : Djinn are 7&#39; to 8&#39; tall.
- **Whirlwind** : The Djinn may transform himself into a raging whirlwind. It takes a full round for the djinn to get up to speed; next round he can start the attack. If he&#39;s Wounded or Shaken during this time, he must start the process over again. Place a Large Burst Template centered on the djinn&#39;s location. Everything inside takes 2d6 damage, and Size +1 or less creatures are picked up and hurled about for the duration of the effect, taking an additional 1d6 damage for each round inside. The whirlwind moves at Pace 10, and the djinn can remain in this form for 3 rounds. At that time, the djinn reappears, and must make a Vigor roll or be Shaken.

### Doppelganger

In their natural state, these creatures are gray skinned and unnaturally thin. They can alter their appearance to look like anyone they&#39;ve ever seen; they&#39;ll often kill a party member, take their place, and attack from within when the group is at its most vulnerable.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d8, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d4, Investigation d8, Notice d8, Persuasion d10, Shooting d6, Stealth d10, Throwing d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 5

Gear:

- Armor/Weapons: The doppelganger will use **whatever gear** the person it&#39;s duplicating uses. Otherwise it&#39;ll be usually armed with a **dagger** (Str+d4).

Special Abilities:

- **Shapeshifting** : The doppelganger can duplicate a target from Size -1 to +1 with a Smarts roll. With a normal success, the copy is extremely close, though it can be detected with a Notice roll at –2. On a raise, the duplication is perfect, down to moles, birthmarks, etc. A doppelganger&#39;s power is considered to be protected by a Conceal Arcana spell at all times; if someone tries to detect it, they should make an opposed roll against the doppelganger&#39;s Smarts.
- **Mind Eaters** : A handful of doppelgangers, legendary even among their own kind, are known as Mind Eaters. They can not only copy the appearance of a target but, by consuming their brain and making a Smarts roll, their memories and skills as well. These memories only last a short time (24 hours with a normal success, 48 with a raise); long enough for them to do considerable damage.

### Elder Dragon ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Elder dragons are the most powerful and rare of their kind, and unlike other dragons they are peaceful and work to aid in the war against evil. They rarely appear in their natural form, using their magic to pass as commoners, but when they do, they appear as great, sinuous Oriental dragons covered in scintillating gold and silver scales, with a mane of silver fire surrounding their heads.

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d12, Intimidation d12, Notice d12, Spellcasting d12

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +4** : Tough, scaly hide.

- **Aura of Majesty** : Elder dragons are incredibly fearsome to creatures of evil intent (Fear -4), and inspirational to those who are true of heart (they get a +4 to all Spirit rolls).
- **Fiery Breath** : Use the Cone Template. All those within the template must make an Agility check at –2 or take 3d8 damage. Those who fail must also must check to see if they catch fire (see SW:EX page 104). The dragon can&#39;t use it&#39;s claw or bite attacks in the same round that it breathes fire.
- **Flight** : Elder dragons have a Flying Pace of 24&quot; (only 12&quot; in the first round, because their massive bodies make it difficult for them to become initially airborne). They have a Climb of 0.
- **Huge** : Elder Dragons are really massive creatures; normal sized foes get a +4 to attack rolls against them.
- **Size +9**
- **Tail Lash** : The dragon can sweep all opponents in its rear facing in a 3&quot; long by 6&quot; wide area. This is a standard Fighting attack and does Str-2 damage.
- **Shapeshifting** : Elder dragons can change their appearance to look like a humanoid, from Size -1 to +1, or any normal (non-magical, average sized) animal with a Smarts roll. They&#39;re not skilled as mimics, so if they attempt to duplicate an existing person, you get a +2 to Notice. Regardless of the form it takes, the dragon retains its Attributes, Pace, and Toughness.
- **Spellcasting** : Elder dragons have 30 power points and the following spells, though feel free to change them as you see fit: Barrier, Blast, Bolt, Detect/Conceal Arcana, Dispel, Invisibility, and Stun. (They&#39;ll never take Armor, relying on their natural toughness to protect them, and will rarely take Fear.)

### Forest Dragon ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These dragons live in jungles and forests. They&#39;re consummate hunters and skilled trackers, and never use their gas attack on any target they intend to eat, as it spoils the taste. They usually make their lairs near salt licks; they eat copious amounts of salt (a process in their stomach breaks the salt down into sodium, which they digest, and chlorine gas, which they expel as their breath weapon). Their coloration varies throughout the year: bright green in spring, darkening through summer, gold and red in fall, and brown/grey in winter. Some even have a mane of leaves which grows and changes with the seasons as well.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d12+4, Vigor d10

### Sky Dragon ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Sky dragons live in deserts and plains, though they spend more time in the air than in their lairs (hence their mottled blue and white coloration; it makes them harder to see while flying). They&#39;re the fastest flyers amongst dragonkind.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d12+6, Vigor d12

### Swamp Dragon ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These dragons live in swamps and marshlands. They typically submerge themselves in the swamp, with only their eyes and nostrils exposed (appearing much like an alligator) and wait for prey to pass by, attacking by surprise. They&#39;re coloration is typically a mixture of black, brown, and mossy green.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d12+3, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d10, Stealth d10, Swim d12

Any armor, clothing or any other items have a 50-50 chance of being ruined (roll d6; on a 1-3 it&#39;s been corroded, destroyed). Characters hit with the acid can neutralize it by immersing themselves in water or applying a base chemical, such as lye.

- **Armor +3** : Thick, scaly hide.
- **Claws/Bite** : Str+d4 damage.

### Dryad

A female spirit of the trees. They are tied to a tree at birth, and die if the tree dies. They&#39;re generally peaceful and reclusive.

Special Abilities:

- **One With the Forest** : Dryads get a +2 to their Notice and Stealth rolls.
- **Charm** : Few men can resist the charms of a dryad. This is the equivalent of the Puppet power; the dryad and target make opposed Spirit rolls. If the dryad wins, the target is under her control. When facing numerous opponents, she&#39;ll use the target to occupy them until she can escape; if facing a single foe, she&#39;ll take them back to her tree and Merge them (see below). A Charmed target remains under control for one hour.
- **Merging** : A dryad can physically merge with her tree by making a Spirit roll. While inside the tree, she can&#39;t be harmed unless the tree is harmed. If she&#39;s taken more than 36&quot; away from her tree, however, she must make a Vigor roll each round or die. A dryad can also force a Charmed opponent to merge with her tree; the target can make a Spirit roll to resist, but failing that, they will be dragged into the tree. Merged victims will live as long as the tree does, and can be freed by the dryad or with a Dispel effect.

### Fire Elemental

Fire elementals appear as a swirling, animated column of flame, roughly 10&#39; high.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d10, Notice d6

Pace: 12; Parry: 7; Toughness: 10

**Edges** : Quick, Two Fisted

Special Abilities:

- **Body of Fire** : Anyone who gets within melee range of a fire elemental must contend with the intense heat; make a Vigor check each round of combat or take a point of Fatigue. Flammable items within adjacent squares must check to see if they catch fire (see SW:EX page 104).

Water based spells or effects cause +4 Damage against them. Fire elementals can&#39;t be summoned within 100 yards of a major body of water, and they cannot cross any amount of water more than 2&quot; wide.

### Water Elemental

Water elementals appear as a semi-solid, swirling mass of water, roughly 10&#39; high.

If the elemental wins, the character is trapped inside and must immediately begin checking against Drowning as in white water (see SW:EX page 104), substituting Vigor rolls in place of Swimming. In order to escape, the trapped character must win an opposed Strength roll against the elemental; if the elemental is Shaken, the trapped character gets a +2 to their roll. Any attack on the elemental that comes up a 1 on the attack die indicates that the trapped character is hit instead (use the Innocent Bystanders rules, SW:EX page 69). The elemental can only drown one character at a time, and cannot move while drowning someone; if it does, the trapped character is freed.
- **Immunity** : The elemental is immune to all water based attacks and effects. Cold based attacks won&#39;t hurt it, but will freeze portions of it; each attack reduces its Pace by 1, but adds 1 to its Toughness, for 1d4 rounds.

### Giant Sturgeon

These creatures are 30&#39; long, and can swallow their prey whole! Use the Giant Shark in Savage Worlds, page 152, adding the following Special Ability:

- **Swallow Whole** : Instead to normally bite its prey, the Sturgeon scoring a success on its Fighting roll can choose to grapple it inside its mouth. Unless the foe can escape, it swallow him on its next action. On a raise, the victim is grappled and swallowed whole in the same action. Those swallowed take 1d8 damage each round against their base Toughness. While inside, a swallowed character can try to cut their way free with a dagger or knife by making an Agility roll at - 2; roll damage against Toughness 8. If you can do at least one wound, you&#39;ve sliced a hole big enough to slip free; you&#39;re automatically Shaken once out. If the sturgeon is killed, you can be freed from the outside in a single round.

### Giant Shark, Megalodon

Megalodon is an extinct species of shark that lived approximately 23 to 2.6 million years ago.

Regarded as one of the largest and most powerful predators in vertebrate history, Megalodon probably had a profound impact on the structure of marine communities. Fossil remains suggest that this giant shark reached a length of 18 metres, and also indicate that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. Scientists suggest that Megalodon looked like a stockier version of the great white shark.

- **Punch** : Str damage. Clay golems are incapable of using weapons, relying solely on their massive clublike fists and smothering attack.
- **Size +2**

- **Sluggish** : Clay golems move at Pace 6, but cannot run. When drawing for initiative, they take two cards and act on the worst of the two.
- **Smother** : If the clay golem gets a raise on its Fighting roll, the target must make an immediate opposed Strength roll against the golem. If the golem wins, it has grabbed the victim by the back of the head and shoved their head into it&#39;s body. The victim will have to make an opposed Strength roll to escape; they&#39;ll also have to begin making Vigor rolls each round or suffer the effects of Drowning (see SW:EX page 104). If the golem hasn&#39;t been directly commanded to kill the victim, it will release them as soon as they become Incapacitated.
- **Weakness (Mark of Creation)**: Clay golems are given life by the magical rune carved into their foreheads. If this mark is removed or altered, the golem collapses, lifeless. Removing the head isn&#39;t sufficient; the body will continue to function normally even if the golem is decapitated. An attack directed specifically at the mark (-6 to Fighting or Shooting rolls) which gets at least a Shaken result is damaging enough to sully the mark and stop the golem (don&#39;t take in account Armor and Size of golem, so Toughness is 7).

### Flesh Golem ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These unfortunate creatures are usually created by Weird Scientists. They&#39;re stitched together from the corpses of murderers executed for their crimes, and unlike other golems it is believed that the flesh carries with it an equally piecemeal soul. Some flesh golems have been able to break the bonds of servitude that go with their creation, though these rogues rarely live long when left to their own devices.

If anyone tries to prevent the victims from marching to their death, they&#39;ll attack (though they&#39;ll get another Spirit roll, again at –2, to break the spell).

### Hobgoblin

Hobgoblins are a militant offshoot of the goblinoid races; some believe that, like Tolkien&#39;s Uruk-Hai, they are a crossbreed between orc and goblin. Not as large or powerful as bugbears and orcs, they&#39;re better trained, highly disciplined, and completely ruthless.

### Hobgoblin Leader ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

The elite of hobgoblin society – if you can call it that – they lead through fear and iron discipline.

### Hydra ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These creatures are similar to dragons, though smaller and lacking wings, and with multiple heads.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d8 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d10

- **Size +4**
- **Large** : Opponents get a +2 to all attack rolls.
- **Many-Headed** : Hydras have 3d4 heads. They can be killed by either attacking the body or by killing all the heads individually. The body uses all the stats listed above; it&#39;s easy to hit due to its size, but harder to damage. An individual head can be Shaken, but this doesn&#39;t effect the others, and as long as at least one head remains un-Shaken, the body can act as well. Heads can be killed with a single Wound (area effect attacks like Blast always hit the body rather than the heads!), and have the following stats:
- **Head** : Parry 7, Toughness 7, -2 to all attack rolls against them (-4 called shot to the head &amp; +2 large creature)
- **Sweep** : Hydras can attack as many adjacent opponents as it has living heads, though it can&#39;t send more than one head after the same target (they tend to get in the way of each other).

### Invisible Devourer

A 10&#39; (2&quot;) square cube, almost completely transparent, which moves through dungeons clearing them of waste and corpses. When they encounter living beings, the devourer&#39;s touch paralyzes them, usually long enough for them to suffocate and the devourer to consume them. It has but one attack: it keeps moving forward, inexorably, until killed.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts -, Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: None

Pace: 2 ; Parry: 2; Toughness: 10

Special Abilities:

- **Consumption** : The devourer attacks simply by moving forward. Opponents in the way, paralyzed or not, are drawn into the devourer&#39;s body (characters who aren&#39;t paralyzed will have to roll against paralyzation each round they&#39;re in the devourer). Characters drawn in must immediately begin making Vigor rolls to keep from suffocating (use the Drowning rules, SW:EX page 95). A swallowed character who remains unparalyzed can try to crawl free with an opposed Strength roll against the devourer. It takes several hours for a devourer to digest a full-sized human; they can&#39;t digest metal or glass, and these will remain inside the devourer for several days, until it can finally expel them as waste.

- **Large** : Opponents get a +2 to all attack rolls.
- **Mindless** : The devourer has no more intellect than an amoeba. It&#39;s immune to Fear, Intimidation, Taunts, and Tricks, as well as any mind-affecting spells or powers.
- **Paralyzing Touch** : Anyone touching a devourer (usually by running into them blindly) must immediately make a Vigor roll or be paralyzed for 1d6 rounds. Application of a Healing spell will eliminate the paralysis, though it will not heal any Wounds the character has suffered.
- **Size +4**
- **Slow** : Devourers have a Pace of 2 and can&#39;t run.
- **Transparent** : Devourers are transparent, almost to invisibility. Make a Notice roll at –2 to see them.

### Killers

### Serial Killer ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Modern books and movies have attributed all sorts of motivations to the serial killer, but in truth there&#39;s only one reason they commit the crimes that they do: to fulfill their sick sexual fantasies.

This version is based on highly organized killers like Ted Bundy: intelligent, educated, and persuasive. The Psychotic Hindrance is common to all of them, but you can add on Cannibal, Necrophilia, etc., as required.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d6, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Driving d6, Fighting d8, Guts d6, Intimidation d10, Lockpicking d6, Notice d8, Persuasion d8, Stealth d10

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 6

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : Psychotic, Wanted; Attractive, Charismatic, Frenzy, Level Headed, Improved Trademark Weapon (weapon of choice)

Gear:

- **Melee Weapon** : Str+d4. This can be any small melee weapon, typically a knife.

Special Abilities:

- **Pain** : Serial killers are adept at inflicting especially painful wounds. Victims Shaken by a serial killers attack take a -2 to their Spirit roll to recover.

### Slasher ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees are the prototypical slashers: powerful, brutal, and all but unstoppable.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d12, Strength d12+2, Vigor d12

Skills: Fighting d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d6, Stealth d10, Throwing d8, Tracking d8

Pace: 6 ; Parry: 7; Toughness: 10

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : Bloodthirsty; Combat Reflexes, Improved Frenzy, Improved Nerves of Steel

Gear:

- **Improvised Weapons** : Str+d6. Slashers some times use a particular weapon (knife, machete), but will often use whatever is at hand, like gardening tools. Whatever they use, it&#39;ll do the same damage.

Special Abilities:

- **Damage Resistance** : Slashers are incredibly tough, getting a +2 to Toughness; this is not armor, so AP attacks get no benefit.
- **He&#39;s Ba-aack** : Slashers are notoriously difficult to kill. Treat this as the Harder to Kill Edge, but the slasher only dies if you roll a 1 on d6.
- **Regeneration** : Slashers can make a Natural Healing roll (see SW:EX page 78) each round to recover damage they&#39;ve taken.
- **Right Behind You!** : Slashers always seem to pop up from nowhere. If a Slasher gets a raise on its Stealth roll, it&#39;s considered Invisible until after its first attack.

### The Bogeyman ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

The Bogeyman lives under beds and in dark closets. He feeds only under cover of darkness; any manflesh will do, though children are his preferred meal.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d8, Spirit d10, Strength d10, Vigor d10

Skills: Climbing d10, Fighting d8, Guts d8, Intimidation d12, Notice d8, Persuasion d10, Stealth d12

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 7

**Edges** : Level Headed, Improved Nerves of Steel

Gear:

- **Knives** : Str+d4 damage. The Bogeyman can produce knives instantly (as the Fast Draw Edge) and at will. No two of them are the same, and he never runs out: he&#39;s perfectly recreating knives that have been used in murders all over the world and throughout time. (The recreation includes the fingerprints and blood of the original killer and victim, which could lead to some interesting investigations...)

Special Abilities:

- **Fear -2**
- **Invulnerability** : Normal attacks can only leave the Bogeyman Shaken.
- **Move in Darkness** : The Bogeyman can travel instantaneously from one place to another, anywhere in the world, so long as it&#39;s completely dark. (Hence his preference for closets and under beds.)
- **See in the Dark** : Lighting penalties are reversed for the Bogeyman:, it sees normally in total darkness, -1 for Dark, -2 Dim, and -6 for full lighting.
- **Weakness (Knives)**: If you manage to get one of the Bogeyman&#39;s own knives away from him, he can be Wounded with it normally. If he&#39;s killed with one, he vanishes into shadow, but isn&#39;t permanently dead; he reforms seven nights later, but can never return to the place where he was &quot;killed&quot;.
- **Weakness (Daylight)**: Direct sunlight does 2d8 damage to the Bogeyman each round, and is the only thing that will kill him permanently.

### The Dreamstalker ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

&quot;One, two, Freddy&#39;s coming for you...&quot;

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8, Spirit d12, Strength d12+1, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d10, Intimidation d12, Notice d10, Stealth d8, Taunt d12

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 9

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : Overconfident; Combat Reflexes, Harder to Kill, Nerves of Steel, Trademark Weapon (bladed glove)

Gear:

- **Bladed Glove** : Str+d6. Since this is worn as a glove, the Dreamstalker can&#39;t be disarmed.

Special Abilities:

- **Damage Resistance** : Dreamstalkers get a +2 to Toughness due to their unnatural origins; this doesn&#39;t count as armor, so AP attacks gain no benefit.
- **Dream Magic** : While in the dreamworld, the Dreamstalker has complete control over the environment. Treat him as having 50 power points and the following spells: Barrier, Deflection, Dispel, Fear, Fly, Obscure, Shape Change (Legendary equivalent), Telekinesis. He can also change the setting at will; for example, the dream may begin in a haunted house, and then suddenly shift to an industrial boiler room.
- **Dreamstalking** : The Dreamstalker normally exists only in dreams. Use the stats listed above; characters attacked in dream use their Smarts for all Agility-based rolls (Fighting, Shooting) and their Spirit in place of Strength and Vigor (damage in hand-to-hand combat, for determining Toughness, etc.). Any Wounds and Injuries the characters suffer in dream carry over to the waking world. While a character is being attacked, other characters must make an opposed Spirit roll against the Dreamstalker to wake the character up. If the attacked character can hold onto the Dreamstalker when they&#39;re awakened, the Dreamstalker is dragged into the waking world with them.
- **Fear -4**
- **Invulnerability** : While in the dreamworld, the Dreamstalker can be Shaken but not Wounded.
- **Weakness (The Waking World)**: The only way to kill the Dreamstalker is by dragging him into the waking world first. He loses his Invulnerability and Dream Magic abilities in the real world.

### The Ripper ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

This malevolent spirit has been called the Murder Elemental, and with good reason. It was around long before the Whitechapel murders, though it was there that it finally earned its name. The Ripper travels ethereally, seeking out men who have fantasized about murder but haven&#39;t acted on these fantasies. Taking control, it forces them to act on these tendencies until its hunger is sated (five murders usually does the trick). Once gone, those who have been possessed either continue on their path of death or commit one final murder by killing themselves.

Attributes: Agility n/a, Smarts d10, Spirit d12, Strength n/a, Vigor n/a

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d10, Intimidation d12, Knowledge (Anatomy) d10, Notice d10, Persuasion d10, Stealth d10, Streetwise d10

Pace: n/a; Parry: 7; Toughness: n/a

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : Bloodthirsty; Danger Sense, Level Headed, Improved Nerves of Steel, Quick Draw

Gear:

- **Knife** : Str+d4. The Ripper always forces the possessed to use a knife as their preferred weapon. Once the Ripper has moved on, the possessed may choose another weapon more suited to their temperament.

Special Abilities:

- **Possession** : The Ripper can take total control over a target with an opposed Spirit roll. It can only take over those who want to kill but haven&#39;t. Once possessed, the target takes on the Ripper&#39;s Smarts and Spirit, as well as all its Skills, Hindrances, and Edges. Their Agility, Strength, and Vigor increase by one die type. They retain their own Skills and Edges. (Where two Skills overlap, use the best of the two.)
- **Ethereal** : In its natural state, the Ripper is both ethereal and invisible, flying about at Pace 12. In this state, it cannot be harmed in any way, but neither can it interact with the physical world.
- **Weakness (Holy Ground)**: The Ripper, either in ethereal form or while possessing a target, cannot set foot on holy ground. If a possessed target is forced onto it, the Ripper is wrenched out of the target; they must make a Spirit roll at -4 or be rendered catatonic for the rest of their natural life. The Ripper can&#39;t possess a new target for 1d6 days as it licks its wounds.
- **Weakness (Ritual Death)**: An ancient ritual exists which can kill the Ripper once and for all; it must be used while the Ripper is in possession of a host body. If the Ripper is trapped at the scene of one of its murders, and that ground is then sanctified by a priest at the same time the possessed is killed, the Ripper is &#39;attached&#39; to the killer&#39;s soul, and is forced to ride along on its trip to Hell, locked together for eternity in the pit.

### Killer Bees, Giant

These are foot-long bees, vicious and fearless. Unlike modern Africanized killer bees, they have barbs on their stingers, so they can strike only once. Since they usually attack in groups of anywhere from twenty to a hundred, though, this is no great comfort to those attacked. Anyone who approaches too close to a killer bee hive will be attacked mercilessly until they are dead or well away from the hive.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d10, Strength d4, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d6

Pace: 4 ; Parry: 5; Toughness: 3

Special Abilities:

- **Slow** : On the ground, killer bees have Pace 4 and cannot run.
- **Flight** : Killer bees have a Flying Pace of 8&quot; with a Climb of 2.
- **Size –2, Small:** Opponents take a -2 to all attack rolls.
- **Fearless** : Killer bees are immune to Fear, and they cannot be Taunted or Intimidated.
- **Sting** : Str+d4, AP 2; if the bee strikes and causes at least a Shaken result, it buries it&#39;s stinger into the target, pumping poison into the wound. The stinger remains in the wound, and the bee dies the next round. Removing the stinger does an additional 2d4 damage to the victim&#39;s base Toughness.
- **Poison** : Anyone wounded or Shaken by the sting attack must make a Vigor roll or gain a level of Fatigue. They take an automatic wound in 1d6 minutes. A Healing roll at –2 prevents this secondary damage. Fatigue levels are recovered at the rate of one per day.

### Killer Mold

Killer Mold is, like corrosive slime, an environmental hazard rather than a true monster. It can

be found in patches of varying sizes (Small, Medium, or Large Burst Template), always underground, and usually scattered with bones and bits of stone and metal.

A hero approaching a Killer Mold must make a Notice roll to spot the Mold in time to avoid the nasty consequences of stepping into it. The Notice roll is modified by lighting conditions and other cirucmstances, as usual.

Any flesh, wood, leather, or other organic that comes in contact with the mold is attacked by a digestive enzyme doing 2d6 damage each round you&#39;re in the mold and for 1d4 rounds after you&#39;ve left. (It takes only one round for the enzyme to eat through a pair of boots and start attacking your feet!)

The mold can be killed with fire; you can clear away a 1&quot; section of it each round with a torch, and a Blast spell of sufficient size will wipe it out entirely. When burned, there&#39;s a 1 in 6 chance the mold will release it&#39;s one defense mechanism: a massive cloud of spores. These spread out in a radius around the mold (1&quot; for Small, 2&quot; for Medium, 4&quot; for Large); anyone caught in the cloud must make a Vigor roll each round they&#39;re inside or take a level of Fatigue. Those reduced below Incapacitated choke to death.

### Kobold

These small (smaller even than goblins) cave dwellers look like a humanoid dog/lizard. They attack from hiding, striking quickly and moving away over and over, harrying their opponents to death.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d4, Spirit d6, Strength d4, Vigor d6

Skills: Climb d8, Fighting d4, Guts d4, Notice d6, Taunt d6, Shooting d8, Stealth d10, Throwing d8

Pace: 6 ; Parry: 4; Toughness: 4

Gear:

- **Blowgun** : 5/10/20, 1d6 damage. With a raise on their Shooting roll, the blowgun dart hits the target in their least armored spot. The darts are typically poisoned; the target must make a Vigor check or take a level of Fatigue. This effect wears off after 1 hour.
- **Small Bow** : 10/20/40, 2d4 damage.
- **Small Javelin** : 3/6/12, Str+d4 damage. These are small, light throwing spears, useless in melee.

Special Abilities:

- **Cowardly** : Kobolds will only initiate an attack when they outnumber their targets by at least 2-to-1. If they&#39;re reduced to even odds, make a Spirit roll for them at –2 each round; failure means they run.
- **Cunning** : Kobolds get a +2 to all their Stealth and Taunt rolls, so long as they outnumber their opponents.
- **Infravision** : They halve all lighting penalties.
- **Size –1**
- **Sprint** : Kobolds can move extremely quickly when necessary; they roll a d10 for Running.

### Leech, Giant

There are certainly creatures deadlier than the giant leech, but few which cause such revulsion. They&#39;re typically 3 to 4 feet long, and live in swamps and bogs. They attach themselves to unwary travellers and drain them dry.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d4, Vigor d4

Skills: Fighting d6, Notice d8, Stealth d8, Swimming d6

Pace: 2 / 6; Parry: 5; Toughness: 2

Special Abilities:

- **Aquatic** : Leeches function equally well in water and on land; they swim at Pace 6.
- **Bite** : Str+d4.
- **Blood Drain** : Any bite from a giant leech which results at least in a Shaken will inject the victim with a numbing poison. Victims take a level of Fatigue every minute (they get a new Notice check when they do); they die if reduced below Incapacitated. The victim must make a Notice roll when unaware of the attack (eg. when the Leech approach with a Stealth roll); otherwise, they won&#39;t even know they&#39;re being killed!
- **Camouflage** : Leeches are almost impossible to see in the murky swampwater of their home; they get a +4 to Stealth rolls there.
- **Size -2**
- **Slow** : On land, leeches move at Pace 2.
- **Weakness (Salt)**: A fistful of salt scattered on a leech will kill it almost instantly.

### Living Statues

Similar to golems in many respects, living statues differ in one key area: they&#39;re independent, sentient beings. These writeups are for statues of roughly human size and shape; living statues can come in any form or size, however.

### Crystal Statue

These appear to be carved from a block of quartz or some other crystal. They are frighteningly quick, vicious opponents, lacking in patience and guile.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d8, Notice d6, Stealth d6

Pace: 8; Parry: 6; Toughness: 8 (2)

**Edges** : Fleet-Footed, Improved Frenzy

Gear:

- **Sword** : Str+d8. These are carved from the same crystal as the statue, and share the statues&#39; vulnerability to sonics (see below).

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +2** : The statue is made of solid crystal.
- **Construct** : Though they are sentient, crystal statues are still considered constructs in many ways. As a result, they gain the following bonuses: +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; constructs do not suffer from poison or disease.
- **Vulnerability (Sonics)**: Crystal statues are vulnerable to sonic and sound-based attacks; they cause the statues to resonate and possibly shatter! Any time a statue is hit with such an attack and is Shaken or Wounded, it must immediately make a Vigor roll or shatter, killing it instantly.

### Iron Statue

These statues can also be of any size or shape, though they are invariably larger and bulkier than crystal statues.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d6, Spirit d8, Strength d12+2, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d10, Notice d4

Pace: 6 ; Parry: 5; Toughness: 11 (3)

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +3**
- **Construct** : Iron statues get the following benefits: +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; constructs do not suffer from poison or disease.
- **Iron Absorption** : Iron golems take no damage from weapons made of iron or steel. In fact, when they&#39;re hit with such a weapon, they can make an Agility roll to trap the weapon inside their body. It remains there until the statue chooses to remove it or until it is killed.
- **Punch** : Str damage.
- **Size +1**

### Stone Statue

These statues appear to be roughly hewn from lava rock filled with magma. Areas where the stone skin is thinner - the eyes, mouth, and joints, glow red hot and sometimes leak lava.

Attributes: Agility d6, Smarts d4, Spirit d10, Strength d12, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d10, Notice d4

Special Abilities:

- **Armor +2**
- **Construct** : Stone statues get the following benefits: +2 to recover from being Shaken; no additional damage from called shots; constructs do not suffer from poison or disease.
- **Last Blast** : When a stone statue is killed, it cracks wide open, spilling out hot magma. This begins in a Small Burst Template, becomes a Medium in the round after that, and a Large in the third round. This does 2d8 damage to anyone in the template; it takes about 15 minutes for the magma to become cool enough to walk on.
- **Magma Blast** : Any round that a stone statue doesn&#39;t Punch, it can belch forth a ball of hot lava. The blast has a 3&quot; range and does 2d8 damage in a Small Burst Template. Anyone or anything hit must check to see if it catches fire (see SW:EX page 104).
- **Punch** : Str+d8 (the extra damage is from the heat of the magma inside the statue).
- **Size +1**
- **Slow** : Stone statues have a Pace of 4, and roll a d4 for running.

- **Tongue Strike** : Horned chameleons can fire their tongues up to 2&quot; with exceptional accuracy (use Throwing skill for this attack), try to grab a target no larger than themselves. This is like a Grapple attack (see SW:EX page 68), and chameleons can damage the target in subsequent rounds using Grapple rules but doing Str+d8 bite damage.

Make an opposed Agility roll; if the medusa wins, the target must make a Spirit roll at -4 or be turned to stone! If the medusa catches sight of her own reflection, she must make the same roll. You can try to fight the medusa with your eyes closed or looking away; it&#39;s the same as fighting in pitch darkness (-4 to attack rolls, SW:EX page 67). A medusa can use this power once per round as a normal action. The gaze has a 10&quot; range.
- **Snakes** : A medusa can attack every adjacent foe with her snakehair, if she makes no other attacks in a round. She must make a single Fighting attack to hit (like the Improved Sweep edge). Every target hit must make a Vigor roll at -2 or take 2d6 damage from poison.

Skills: Fighting d10, Notice d4

Pace: 4; Parry: 7; Toughness: 13

Special Abilities:

- **Fearless** : Greater mummies are immune to Fear and Intimidation effects.
- Single Minded: Greater mummies have intense focus and sense of purpose. They get a +2 to resist Smarts-based Tricks.

### Mummy Lord ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Mummy Lords are as rare as they are powerful. They have been damned to eternal life as a mummy as punishment for an offense against their Pharaoh; they&#39;re usually set to guard over the greatest secrets - or treasures! - of the desert.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d10, Spirit d12, Strength d12+4, Vigor d12

Skills: Fighting d12, Guts d12, Notice d6

Pace: 6; Parry: 8; Toughness: 10

**Hindrances &amp; Edges** : All Thumbs; Improved Arcane Resistance, Improved Level Headed

Special Abilities:

- **Body of Sand** : They can turn into a swirling column of sand. In this form they can pass through openings as small as a keyhole, and can&#39;t be harmed by physical attacks. While in this form, they can fly at Pace 15, Acceleration 10, and can carry up to five passengers.
- **Call the Sandstorm** : Once a day, a Mummy Lord can call forth a massive sandstorm, covering many square miles of desert. Treat this as a massive version of the Obscure power. The mummy can move and control the storm, but doing so requires his constant attention; if he&#39;s Shaken or distracted in any other way (by a successful Trick, for example), the storm blows itself out at the end of the round. It can only use this power when its Canoptic Jars are all filled.
- **Canoptic Jars** : When first awakened, Mummy Lords have two levels of Fatigue and appear completely desiccated. They regain their human appearance and remove the Fatigue levels by murdering humans and placing their organs inside their canoptic jars; each human murdered removes one Fatigue level.
- **Command the Dead** : Once a day, a mummy lord can forth aid; it can summon a dozen Lesser Mummies who will do it&#39;s bidding. The Mummy Lord has the following Edges with these summoned mummies only: Command, Fervor, and Hold the Line!
- **Fear -2** : Mummy Lords incur a Guts roll (-2) in those who see them.
- **Invulnerability** : Normal attacks can only leave the Mummy Lord Shaken.
- **Undead** : +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; No wound penalties; Immune to disease and poison; No additional damage from called shots.
- **Weakness (Book of Life)**: Mummy Lords are called forth by the Book of the Dead; the only way to put them to rest again is by reading from the Book of Life. When the appropriate passage is read aloud within 12&quot; of the Mummy Lord, it loses all of its powers (though it retains its Attributes, Skills, and Edges). Reading from the Book takes 3 rounds, during which the reader can only move at half Pace and can take no other actions.
- **Weakness (Cats)**: Mummy Lords are deathly afraid of cats, and must make a Guts check at -4 whenever seeing one or flee immediately. It&#39;s believed that cats remove a Mummy Lord&#39;s Invulnerability, but so far no one has put this to the test.

### Murlocs

The murlocs are amphibious frog-like creatures which dwell along the coastlines of the Eastern Kingdoms, and few other locations. Little is known about this species, although they seemingly have enough intellect to form societies and tribes, even having their own faith system.

### Naga

The naga are mutated Highborne, an elite part of the ancient night elf culture. They have snake-like tails in place of legs, and have other serpentine features such as scales and fins. Their queen made a pact with the Old Gods to save the Highborne, thus the Old Gods cursed them and twisted them into the naga. The naga capital lies underneath the Great Maelstrom. Males are large, with muscular arms and torso, and additionally have two dorsal fins starting near their tail and running up their back, short tentacles erupting from their chin, and are most often dark blue. Females are slimmer by comparison, have four arms, larger dorsal fins and are usually a pale green color. Their faces are much more humanoid compared to the males&#39; snake-like snouts. The females also tend towards the role of spellcasters, as opposed to the male warriors.

### Naga Myrmidon

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d6, Strength d12, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d10, Notice d6, Shooting d8, Stealth d8 (+4 while in water), Swimming d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 10 (1)

Special Abilities:

- **Aquatic** : They are native to the water, natural swimmers, and cannot drown. While in the water, their Pace is equal to Swimming skill.
- **Armor +1** : Coral Scales
- **Size +2**

Gear:

- **Coral Blade** : Str+d10
- **Net** : Range 2/4/8. The Naga&#39;s Shooting skill roll is opposed by the target&#39;s Agility. Success indicates partial restraint so that the target suffers a –2 penalty to Pace and skills linked to Agility and Strength. A raise restrains the target fully. He cannot move or use any skills linked to Agility or Strength. Each following action, an entangled target may make a Strength or Agility roll to break free. Other characters may also attempt to free the ensnared person by making a Strength roll at –2.

They make a Touch attack with appropriate modifiers for called shots (no penalty for targeting a foes suit of full plate armor, for example); with a success on their attack roll, the item rusts. Armor will lose a point of defense bonus with each attack, shields lose a point of Parry bonus, and weapons lose a step of Damage (so, a d6 short sword become a d4). When the bonus is reduced to 0 (or the Damage&#39;s lower than d4), the item is useless. Miscellaneous items will survive 1-3 attacks based on their mass, at the GM&#39;s discretion.

### Screaming Fungus

This is an environmental hazard, like the Corrosive Slime. Patches of this fungi are typically fairly large (Large Burst Template sized), yellow-grey in color, and dotted with fungi-covered bones of various creatures.

Anyone setting foot on a fungus will &#39;hear&#39; a horrible scream inside their head. They&#39;ll have to make a Spirit roll immediately or be paralyzed by the scream and unable to move. Each subsequent round they must continue making Spirit rolls or take levels of Fatigue. Once reduced to Incapacitated, they collapse, and fungus will begin growing on them at an astonishing pace, completely covering the character. They&#39;ll have to make a Vigor roll each round or die, suffocated by the fungus.

The &#39;scream&#39; is psychic in nature, and only those in contact with the fungus can actually hear it. (Characters with a psychic-based Arcane Background might be able to, though they wouldn&#39;t suffer the full effects unless in contact with the fungus.)

They can teleport up to 5&quot; in any direction (they cannot pass through walls, doors, or other barriers) in place of normal movement, both before and after their attack! In any round where they have initiative, they can blink in, attack, and blink away without fear of counterattack unless the target has the First Strike Edge. Characters who get the initiative and remain on Hold can attack normally when the hounds teleport in to attack.

### Shadow Panther

These creatures appear to be panthers viewed through a greasy kaleidoscope; they have too many eyes, too many legs, and seem to sprout tentacles periodically, only to absorb them a moment later.

### Spectre ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Malevolent spirits from beyond the grave, spectres feed on fear and are among the most feared of the undead.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d12, Strength n/a, Vigor d10

Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d8, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d12+2

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 9

Special Abilities:

- **Chilling Touch** : By making a touch attack, a spectre can drain vitality. Make a Vigor roll at -2; if you fail, you lose 1 die type of both Strength and Vigor. If either of these is reduced under d4, the victim is Incapacitated and will die in 1d6 rounds. A Healing spell will return one level of each Attribute, while Greater Healing will return all lost levels. Another spell or mundane Healing is required to remove Incapacitation status.
- **Fear -2** : A spectre must be visible to use this power.
- **Incorporeal** : Normally, a spectre is invisible and incorporeal. When it decides to use its touch attack, it becomes visible and partially corporeal and must remain so for 3 rounds. In this state, it can still only be harmed by Arcane effects, or magic or blessed weapons. It can become visible at any time, for as long as it wishes, while still remaining incorporeal.
- **Undead** : +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; No wound penalties; Immune to disease and poison; No additional damage from called shots.
- **Unholy Spirit** : Spectres cannot enter onto sanctified ground, and must make a Guts check in the face of holy symbols.

Widows aren&#39;t the largest of the giant spiders, but their venom is particularly potent.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d8, Strength d12, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d10, Guts d8, Notice d10, Stealth d8

Pace: 6; Parry: 7; Toughness: 6

**Edges** : Quick

Make a Vigor roll at -4; if you fail, you take 2d10 damage and a level of Fatigue. If you succeed, you only take the Fatigue level. After 2d6 minutes, make another Vigor roll at -4; if you fail, you die. If you succeed, you take another Fatigue level. Lost Fatigue returns at 1 level per day of rest.
- **Web** : Widows are web spinners. Roll character Notice against the spider Stealth to notice the web and avoid it. Anything in the web must cut or break their way free (Toughness 9). Webbed characters can still fight, but all physical actions are at -4.

### Brown Recluse (Fiddleback)

Fiddlebacks are lurking spiders; they hunt by hiding in a darkened area and waiting for their prey to come close. Their venom slowly eats away at flesh, stripping it down to the bone unless healed.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d4 (A), Spirit d10, Strength d12+2, Vigor d8

- **Size +4**
- **Venom (-2)**: if the giant Fiddleback gets at least a Shaken result with his Bite, it injects the target with its horrible poison. Make a Vigor roll at -2; if you fail, you take 2d8 damage and 2 levels of Fatigue. If you succeed, you only take the Fatigue level. Either way, the poison must be removed within an hour, and the wound thoroughly cleaned (a Greater Healing spell will accomplish this, as well as an Healing roll at -2, but because so much flesh must be removed to get out the poison it inflicts a Wound at the same time!). If not removed, the area will rapidly begin to rot, and after 12 hours of excruciating pain, use the Injury table to determine the result of the poison damage. Lost Fatigue returns at 1 level per day of rest.

As if the other giant spiders weren&#39;t big enough, giant tarantulas are truly monstrous creatures (perfect for attacking isolated desert towns in the 50&#39;s...).

### Squid, Giant: The Kraken ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

Perhaps no creatures inspire more fear in sailors than sharks and sea serpents. Only one creature strikes fear in the hearts of sharks and serpents: the Kraken!

- **Fear -4**
- **Gargantuan** : Opponents get a +4 to all attack rolls.
- **Size +10**
- **Tentacles** : Str+d10Damage. Treat these as Heavy Weapons. When attacking ships, the kraken ignores their Armor bonus.

Breaking free with raw strength is all but impossible; wriggling free with an Agility roll at -2 is more likely.
- **Tough Hide** : Armor +5; counts as Heavy Armor.

### Stalker ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

These creatures from the elemental plane of air are often summoned by wizards to act as trackers or hunters. They&#39;ll follow their instructions to the letter, but hate their enforced servitude, so they&#39;ll attempt to twist any command given to them which isn&#39;t stated as simply and clearly as possible.

### Svetocher

Svetochers are the tortured and horrific offspring of vampires and humans. While some legends recount the dhampir, these monsters are much more common to be born by ripping its way from its mother&#39;s womb and to stalk the homeland until a hunter is brave or lucky enough to destroy it.

These creatures live in the blackest lagoons, usually in South and Central America. They are reclusive so long as their territory isn&#39;t invaded. If anyone enters their hunting ground, they&#39;re fair game. Swamp monsters prefer to steal up underwater and attack from below whenever possible.

Make a Vigor roll when you come within 3&quot; of a troglodyte. Failure means you are violently ill: you&#39;re Shaken and take a Fatigue level. Success means you just take the Fatigue level; with a Raise there&#39;s no effect. Lost Fatigue returns with 5 minutes of fresh air.

### Troll hunter ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

### Wendigo ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

The Wendigo is a mythical creature appearing in the mythology of the Algonquian people. It is a malevolent cannibalistic spirit into which humans could transform, or which could possess humans. Those who indulged in cannibalism were at particular risk, and the legend appears to have reinforced this practice as a taboo. Wendigo psychosis is a culture-bound disorder which involves an intense craving for human flesh and the fear that one will turn into a cannibal.

Attributes: Agility d10, Smarts d8, Spirit d8, Strength d12+3, Vigor d12

- **Weakness** : Werebears suffer normal damage from silver weapons.

### Werefox

Werefoxes are much smarter than their lycanthropic cousins and very clever. They can even speak human language and, with proper concealing clothing, can even try to pass themselves off as humans. They are tricksey and cowardly sorts who will lie, beg, steal, and ambush to achieve their particular goals, what ever they may be, and will even use weapons and other technology if available.

Despite their intelligence and wits, they are still opportunistic predators and scavengers at heart and will not pass up a meal either dug up from a shallow grave or scrounged in a trash heap.

Swampwater Joe is a unique lycanthrope, appearing either as disgustingly obese human or as a massive, feral hog. He lives in a shack back in the depths of the swamp, where he brings his victims to be hung up and butchered for meat... dead or not.

Wolf-men are a form of werewolf, more in keeping with old, B-horror movies like _I Was a Teenage Werewolf than Ginger Snaps_ or _Dog Soldiers_.

### Wight

Known as &quot;the frozen dead&quot; for their pale blue skin and ice-blue eyes, wights are terrifying foes: corpses with a part of their decayed soul still in residence, often draining life from their victims.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6, Spirit d10, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d8, Guts d10, Intimidation d10, Notice d8, Stealth d12

Pace: 6; Parry: 6; Toughness: 10 (2)

**Edges** : Quick

Gear:

- **Armor/Weapons** : The Wight wear the gear he had while alive. He&#39;s usually armed with an ancient, rusting sword (Str+d6), and pieces of his once precious armor (+2).

Special Abilities:

- **Claws** : Str+d4. Wights also drain warmth and life from the victim: a character clawed by a wight must make a Vigor roll; failure means you lose 1 die type of Vigor and take 1 Fatigue level. On a success, you only take the Fatigue; with a raise, there&#39;s no effect. Lost Fatigue and Vigor returns in 1 hour, provided you have somewhere to warm up.
- **Damnation of the Soul** : Any humanoid slain by a wight has a 50% chance of become one of them within 1d4 rounds. The spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not retain any of the abilities they had in life.
- **Darkvision** : Wights can see in complete darkness and through the thickest smoke or fog; all lighting penalties are cut in half.
- **Fear** : Anyone who sees a wight must make a Guts check.
- **Fearless** : Wights are immune to Fear and Intimidation.
- **Undead** : Wights gain the following benefits: +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; Immune to poison and disease; No additional damage from called shots.

### Zombies

Here are a few alternatives to the standard SW zombies.

![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_4b9773869df4da28.png) Shape Change, Impossible, Undead/Magical/Radiation/Viral Outbreak

### Rage Zombie

Not zombies in the strictest sense, these are humans who have been infected with Rage, an experimental and viciously contagious virus which attacks the human brain (specifically the emotional center). Victims become feral killing machines, running on pure instinct until they finally burn out, a process which typically takes about 2 months.

Attributes: Agility d8, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d10, Strength d8, Vigor d8

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d8, Intimidation d8, Notice d6, Throwing d4

Pace: 8 ; Parry: 3; Toughness: 8

**Edges** : Combat Reflexes

Special Abilities:

- **Berserk** : Rage zombies are permanently Berserk. They take a -2 to their Parry, and get a +2 to all their Fighting and Strength rolls and to their Toughness.
- **Bite/Claws** : Str damage.
- **Fast** : Rage zombies move at a Pace of 8 and roll a d8 for Running.
- **Fearless** : These zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation, and need never make morale checks. They will attack until every non-zombie within sight is dead (and most likely devoured) or until they are themselves killed.
- **Infection** : Rage is incredibly infectious; any scratch or bite from a Rage zombie which results at least in a Shaken will infect the victim unless they make a Vigor roll at -2. Failure means that they will succumb to the virus and become a Rage zombie within 1d4 rounds. There is no cure or treatment for Rage except death.
- **Weakness (Daylight)**: Bright light, especially sunlight, is painful to the Rage zombies. Unless directly provoked, they won&#39;t venture into sunlight, and if they do, they suffer a -2 penalty to all their rolls.

### Shambling Dead (Romero Zombie)

These zombies are mindless automatons with a taste for living human flesh. They&#39;re attracted by light and noise, and have been known to seek out familiar places and continue old routines even in death. Individually They&#39;re usually not a match for an armed foe, but in packs of a dozen (or fifty, or a hundred...) they shouldn&#39;t be underestimated.

Attributes: Agility d4, Smarts d6 (A), Spirit d6, Strength d6, Vigor d6

Skills: Fighting d6, Guts d6, Notice d4

Pace: 4 ; Parry: 3; Toughness: 7

Special Abilities:

- **Bite/Claws** : Str damage.
- **Fear**
- **Fearless** : Shambling zombies are immune to Fear and Intimidation, with one exception: they have an animals&#39; instinctive fear of fire, and suffer a -2 to any Guts checks involving fire.
- **Infection** : Anyone bitten by a shambler must immediately make a Vigor roll at -2; failure means that they&#39;ve been infected. The disease will incubate for 1d6 hours, at which point the victim must make subsequent Vigor rolls, also at -2, each hour or become Fatigued. When reduced to Incapacitated, the victim dies and within 1d4 minutes will rise as a new shambling dead. There is no cure or treatment. Anyone killed by them always comes back as a shambler, in 1d4 minutes.
- **Invulnerability** : Attacks to anywhere but the head can only leave a shambler Shaken; they can only be killed by injury to the brain. (Dismemberment, by making called shots to the limbs with an edged weapon, will render them helpless of course, and attacks which affect the body as a whole, such as explosions or fire, will kill the zombie as well.)
- **Slow** : Shamblers have a Pace of 4 and cannot run. They&#39;re largely incapable of defending themselves as well, suffering a -2 Parry.
- **Undead** : +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; Called shots do no extra damage (except to the head).
- **Weakness (Head)**: Shots to a zombie&#39;s head are +2 damage.

### Raimi Zombie ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

However, the limb will take on a life of its own!
- **Leaping** : Raimi zombies can leap 6&quot;, +2&quot; with a Strength roll.
- **Undead** : +2 Toughness; +2 to recover from being Shaken; Called shots do no extra damage (except to the head). No Wound penalties.

### Zombie Lord ![](RackMultipart20200510-4-2b5m4r_html_fdd6db35ce9c2ceb.png)

When there was no more room in Hell, and the dead began to walk the earth, humankind (the living ones, that is) was all but wiped out. It was discovered soon after that a select few children born after the Zombie Apocalypse had been mutated by whatever force had brought the dead back to life.
