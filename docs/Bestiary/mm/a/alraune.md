# Alraune

The alraune is a plant-based creature that appears as an attractive
green-skinned woman resting upon a huge flower. However the flower and
humanoid portion are actually parts of the same thorny plant, which
moves around using its roots and vines, and uses the calming fragrance
of its flower to captivate its victims.
