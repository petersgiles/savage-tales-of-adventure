Blightspawn

Blightspawn are massive mosquito-like creatures the size of a fully
grown man. They gestate in the body of a willing cultist, bursting from
the host body when it dies or undergoes a special dark ritual. The newly
emerged blightspawn is fully grown, but cannot fly until it spends a
full round clearing the gore from its wings.
