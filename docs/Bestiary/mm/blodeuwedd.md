Blodeuwedd

The blodeuwedd are a type of fae related to dryads, and magically
bond with grasslands and plains, although unlike dryads they can leave
their domain if they wish. In their natural form they appear as maidens
with grass-like hair and mossy skin, but they are also able to
shapechange into human or elven form, or into animals native to their
domain.
