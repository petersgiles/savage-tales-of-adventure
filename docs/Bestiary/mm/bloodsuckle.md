Bloodsuckle

Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent carnivorous plants that use
vine-like tendrils to consume the blood of the unwary. They also inject
sap into living victims, turning them into hosts to serve and protect
them. Bloodsuckles can sense all hosts within 18", and may summon all
hosts within two miles. Once per month, they can implant a host with a
seed, which grows into a new bloodsuckle over a period of several days.
