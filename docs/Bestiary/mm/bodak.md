# Bodak

Bodaks appear as emaciated humanoids with charred flesh, and empty
eyes sockets trailing plumes of black smoke. Their gaze inflicts one
wound for each success and raise, and those killed by it will rise as a
bodak themselves the following night. Bodaks suffer a level of Fatigue
every round they are exposed to sunlight, and are destroyed if
incapacitated.
