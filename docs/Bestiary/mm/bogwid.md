Bogwid

Bogwids are solitary asexual amphibians that drag themselves around
using their muscular tentacles. Their moist skin is dark green, and
their back is covered in throbbing, quivering fist-sized pustules
containing their larvae. The larvae are able to burst from the pustules
and launch themselves at victims, attaching themselves with suckered
mouths and feeding deeply with their jagged fangs. Should the victim
die, the larvae will burrow into the corpse and gestate over a couple of
weeks, eventually bursting out as an adolescent bogwid.
