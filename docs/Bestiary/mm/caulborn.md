# Caulborn

The caulborn are a telepathic humanoid race of prophets and
historians. Their pale skin is hairless, and a fleshy hood of skin
covers the part of their face where their eyes would be. They have two
mouths, the upper one human-like while the lower mouth stretches and
splits their jaw like a pair of mandibles. Their index and middle
fingers are elongated with multiple joints. They are self-sustaining,
and dedicate their lives to the collection of memories.
