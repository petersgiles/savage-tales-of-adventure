- **Armour +4:** Tough flesh.
- **Bite:** Str+d6.
- **Anti-Magic Eye:** At the end of the creature's movement for the
round, it may place a Cone Template to indicate where its anti-magic eye
is looking. This automatically dispels and prevents any magic from being
used within the cone, including the creature's own eye rays.
- **Eye Rays:** Shooting; range 12/24/48; RoF 5; Each victim can be
targeted by a maximum of two rays per attack. After making the attack
roll, choose one of the Eye Ray abilities for each successful hit. Only
Eye Ray (Damage) can be chosen more than once per attack.
- **Barrage:** The creature draws two initiative cards due to Level
Headed, and acts normally on the higher card. However it can also use
the lower initiative card to make a second attack with its Eye Rays as
long as it isn't Shaken.
- **Darkvision:** No vision penalties for darkness (range 12").

bonuses.

- **Eye Ray (Sleep)** The victim must make a Spirit roll (at -2 on a
raise) or fall asleep (and prone). They can be woken by an adjacent
character as a normal action.
- **Eye Ray (Slow)** The victim must make a Spirit roll (at -2 on a
raise) otherwise they can no longer move as a free action for the
remainder of the scene.
- **Eye Ray (Charm)** The victim must make a Spirit roll (at -2 on a
raise) otherwise they consider the creature a friend, and will attempt
to help it (although this doesn't cause them to turn on their allies
except as a last resort).
- **Eye Ray (Fear)** The victim must make a Fear check (at -2 on a
raise).
- **Eye Ray (Telekinesis)** The victim must make a Spirit roll (at -2 on
a raise) or be moved 2d6" in a direction of the creature's choice. If
this causes the victim to be bashed into a solid object, they suffer the
creature's Spirit+d6 as damage.
- **Eye Ray (Damage)** The victim suffers 2d8 damage. If the victim is
incapacitated by the damage, the creature can choose to disintegrate or
petrify them instead (but only a maximum of one of each per attack).
