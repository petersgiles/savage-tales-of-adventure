# Herald of the pirate queen

This seemingly haunted pirate ship flickers with ominous lights, but
there is no crew. The vessel is actually a living creature with
malevolent intelligence, capable of raising and lowering its own sails,
opening and closing its doors, and even throwing people overboard if it
wishes, using telekinesis. It can be negotiated with, demanding payment
in the form of treasure, and is capable of moving underwater when it
wishes.
