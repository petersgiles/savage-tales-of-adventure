- **Multiple Heads:** This creature has multiple heads, each of which
can make a Fighting roll or use its breath weapon without incurring a
MAP, although each head can only perform one action each round, and no
more than four heads can attack a single target. A Called Shot to the
head that causes Shaken or inflicts wounds automatically severs one
head, and the creature dies if all its heads are severed.
- **Regrow heads:** When the creature draws Hearts for initiative, any
severed heads are replaced with two new ones at the beginning of its
turn, although it can never exceed twice its normal number of heads.
Heads that were severed with acid or fire attacks do not regenerate. A
character may also make a Called Shot touch attack with an acid or fire
weapon, cauterizing a stump on a successful hit (don't roll for damage
in this case).
- **Breath Weapons:** All targets within a Cone Template must make an
Agility roll at -2 or suffer 2d10 damage. If a victim is targeted by
multiple breath attacks from the same hydra in the same round, they only
need to make one Agility roll, and if it fails they only suffer the
damage once.
