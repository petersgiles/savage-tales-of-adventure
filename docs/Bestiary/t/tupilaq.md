# Tupilaq

Tupilaqs are small humanoid constructs carved from whale bones,
possessed by the spirit of a child, and utilised as assassins. If their
creator places a drop of blood on a tupilaqs head, it can sense the
location of the creature the blood came from, and will track them
relentlessly until they are dead.
