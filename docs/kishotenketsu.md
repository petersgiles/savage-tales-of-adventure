# Japanese Storytelling

## [Kish≈çtenketsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish%C5%8Dtenketsu)

Traditional Japanese storytelling technique called kishotenketsu. Essentially, it works like this:

- **Ki**,  or introduction. E.g. There's this really amazing magical city.
- **Sho**, or development. E.g. They practice human sacrifice, which most players will try to stop.
- **Ten**, or twist/divergence/false appearance. E.g. The sacrifices were actually keeping a tarrasque miles below the city from waking.
- **Ketsu**, or resolution. E.g. You must now fight a tarrasque, or otherwise solve the problem

## Example

- **Ki**, A man is very skittish and inarticulate. He might tell the PCs "Not fwiends!"
- **Sho**, He pickpockets people out of habit. He acts childish or animalistic.
- **Ten**, He is actually a very talented thief in the local thieves' guild but was hit by a Feeblemind spell during a major heist of the mage's college.
- **Ketsu**, He will owe a favor to anyone who cures him. He will remember how people treated him when the effect wears off.

The main difference is that there isn't necessarily conflict. There's no climax, rising action, falling action until the players create it. The first three parts are simple facts in the world or inevitable events. The resolution is the result of player action. If players act differently, the resolution might not be a fight.

It's way easier than Western storytelling because Western story structure is all about the characters and their journeys, which the DM has no control over! It leads to railroading, improv, and other things that (to me) are simultaneously more work for the DM and less fun for players.

Not all "ten" are equal (e.g. a baker who puts sand in his bread vs. another who puts orc poison). My players are more predictable because they know every location has some kind of secret to uncover. Or rather, they know there are several secrets, and they want to find the best one.

It's also way easier to start and stop sessions because each step is interesting in some way, and my players aren't just waiting for the next fight. They're always uncertain about where the fight will come from and trying to find creative ways to get around the twist.

Kishotenketsu also made a lot of other changes easier. For example, my players do way more active roleplaying because they're more engaged with my locations.

My NPCs are more interesting because I use the same principle: first impression, character development, hidden secret, things the NPC will do if the players help/harm them.

My boss fights as well: monster appears, monster attacks, monster has secret ability or relationship to environment, players defeat or run away from the monster.

Most importantly, both my players and I feel like we have control. Again, kishotenketsu isn't about characters. It's about the world and events. The story is already there, and players get to uncover and affect it. I feel like I am in complete control of every situation while my players feel like they have complete control over the resolution. They can go wherever they want and have a fun adventure. I now DM about 10 hours per week and don't feel burnt out at all. My players and I are both excited for the next session.

resolution includes everything after the twist. Defeating the monster, collecting the reward, pouring drinks with the NPCs, etc. But most of that is player-driven, and all the components are in place from the earlier stages, so the DM doesn't need to worry about it as much until it circles back to introduction for the next adventure.

Finally, the beginning of my journey was probably my experience with the first Dark Souls game. The story already exists in the world, and players can engage with it as much as and however they want. I try not to make things quite that opaque, but the overall approach is comparable.
