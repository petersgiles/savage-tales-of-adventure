# Running a game

## Introduction

I was recently planning a large-scale siege I wanted to run for my party, and was trying to figure out how best to do so. Lots of the large battle systems I found were rules-heavy and highly focused on strategy and mechanics. This wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I wanted my players to feel like Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn at the battle of Helm's deep. I wanted them to make decisions and take actions which would turn the tides of the battle, not necessarily because of strategic genius, but because they were awesome. So here is my narrative focused, rules-light method for doing so. I based it off of some of the ideas of abstraction in combat from systems like Fate Core. This system requires that those involved be in a very narrative-focused mindset. If you’re here for a rich mechanical system you won’t get it. It isn’t balanced, it isn’t airtight, but when I ran it, it was fun as hell.

## What You'll Need

In order to make this work you still need full stat blocks for all kinds of enemy creatures in the opposing army. I ran it with stats for basic soldiers, special units like berserkers and scouts, and stat blocks for a few high-profile targets like the leading general. You’ll need a mental (and possibly visual) map of the area of engagement but probably won’t need an actual battle map. It also helps to have notes on what sort of siege weaponry each side has, if any. This can be useful for descriptive flavor and opportunities for your players to do really cool stuff.

## Heroic Actions

At the beginning of the battle, each player roles a d4 and records the number. If they want they can spend any inspiration dice they have to add +1 to this number. This is the number of Heroic Actions they have for this stage of the fight. Every time they do a Heroic Action they will spend one of these. Once everyone runs out, they can re-roll. Heroic Actions are sort of like legendary actions. They can be used at any time during the battle, but can be more abstract than a normal action. Try to encourage players to take turns, but let them decide the best narrative order in which to spend their actions. Don’t enforce a strict order. You can do 4 things with Heroic Actions. Fight, Move, Cast, and Other.

Fight The player either wants to attack one high profile target, or a bunch of normal targets. If they’re attacking a high profile target just treat everything like normal. They roll against AC and roll for damage, taking away some hp. However, if they’re attacking a unit (like a soldier or berserker), have them roll 1d20 against the armor class of that unit. If they succeed, don’t worry about damage. This is a narrative success. They succeed at cutting a swath some ways into the enemy forces, thinning the enemy ranks with arrows, or holding off the swarms of orcs coming over the bridge.

Move Sometimes positioning is more important than combat. So long as a player can find an avenue to get around the monstrous hordes, they should be able to move a long way. If they’re jumping across rooftops or something have them make an acrobatics or athletics check, but overall the players will be able to do much more interesting things if you let them get around the battlefield easily.

Cast BUFF SPELLS. Let them be more powerful than usual. Let players cast two per heroic action. Still keep track of spell slots, still make people roll spell attacks or saving throws, but let your spell-casters blow some stuff up! Creative spell use can really shape the battlefield and make things interesting. Just like in Fight, if spells are cast are against units, treat a failed save on behalf of the unit or successful spell attack roll on behalf of the caster as an overall success on whatever they caster is trying to do. If it’s against a high profile target use normal rules.

Other Maybe this is a last minute rescue for a player about to plummet off a wall and to their untimely doom. Maybe something else. Make the player roll for a skill check, and if they pass they should have a huge success.

## Consequences

When your players aren’t taking Heroic Actions assume that they are surviving. They’re exceptional heroes and should be able to hold their ground in battle. They shouldn’t be advancing or making forward progress, but they should be able to stay alive. If the good guys are retreating, so will they. If the good guys are pushing forward already, they can too. The only time a player should be enacting meaningful change on the battlefield is through the use of Heroic Action. However, acting heroically is a risky business, and should incur consequences, such as unwanted attention from the enemy. At the end of a player’s heroic action, you will have to make a judgement call and roll a dice for how many attacks they incur from the opposing forces. These can be thrown weapons, arrows, or melee attacks. It also doesn’t matter if these attacks all come from one enemy or many. Whatever makes more narrative sense. Here’s how to decide which die to roll.

No Risk (0) The player drew no attention to themselves. This most often happens during a Move action, or if they deliberately wanted to do something stealthy. They’ll incur no attacks from this action.

Mild Risk (1d4) The player remained in a relatively safe position or didn’t draw too much attention to themselves during their action. This is a big battle, so there’s still a risk of incurring up to four attacks from the enemy.

High Risk (1d6) The player pulled off something that draws the ire of the enemy, or ended their action in a dangerous position. They risk up to six attacks.

Huge Risk (1d8) The player did something to paint a target on themselves or landed right in the middle of the fight. Hopefully whatever they tried was worth it. They risk up to 8 attacks.

## The Flow Of Battle

Lastly, a few notes on how this will actually run. The DM is essentially telling a story where the players can interrupt at any time in order to address new threats as they arise, or to act against the enemy. The nature of the consequences listed above is that the fight should wear the players down. As things carry on they WILL take hits and they WILL run out of resources. To compensate for this, only create a few high profile targets, who will act like boss fights during the battle. The goal should pretty clearly be to reach and defeat these targets, unless you want to try getting creative and set other goals. The above consequences will compensate for the high profile targets being at a disadvantage in terms of the action economy.

Decide what you're willing to let players accomplish during a Heroic Action ahead of time, or at least have a vague idea. If a player wants to do something that you think is too much for one action, work with them to make it more reasonable. There is no "right amount" of things a player can do on a Heroic Action, but once you decide what works for your game, make sure you're consistent. As stated above, I found that two spells (with exaggerated effects) per Cast action was a good amount. Move actions aren't that exciting, so the most fun option for the players is usually just to let them go wherever they want as long as there's an open route. Fight actions are tricky, as they can range from a good description of a player kicking ass, to players pushing through enemy ranks towards the big bad. Use your best judgement, and negotiate with the players when an action seems to big. I found that players were usually satisfied with Fight actions so long as descriptions were cool, even if they didn't always have a massive affect on the overall fight.
